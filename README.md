## Overview üìã

This Arduino project encompasses comprehensive documentation, including codes, pertinent applications, and circuit diagrams, for the development of an innovative Vacuum Cleaner. This intelligent vacuum cleaner is equipped with four distinct modes, each designed to optimize functionality and user experience:

- **Obstacle Avoidance Mode**: Employs advanced sensors to navigate around obstacles seamlessly, ensuring efficient cleaning without interruptions.
- **Mobile Phone Remote Control Mode**: Allows users to control the vacuum cleaner remotely via a dedicated mobile application, providing convenience and flexibility in operation.
- **Voice Recognition Mode**: Harnesses cutting-edge voice recognition technology to enable hands-free operation, responding to verbal commands for enhanced user interaction.
- **Face Recognition Mode**: Utilizes sophisticated facial recognition algorithms to identify users and personalize cleaning preferences, optimizing efficiency and convenience.

Additionally, the project includes a supplementary code file for an Infrared (IR) gate, serving as a boundary safeguard. This demonstration underscores the vacuum cleaner's ability to operate effectively in complex environments, showcasing its adaptability and reliability.

For each mode, dedicated companion applications are available for download, enhancing the user experience and functionality. Detailed instructions and download links for these applications are provided in a separate document, facilitating seamless integration and utilization of the vacuum cleaner's capabilities.

This project represents a culmination of innovative technologies and meticulous design, aimed at delivering an advanced cleaning solution tailored to modern needs and preferences.

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

### Obstacle Avoidance:
An Ultrasonic Sensor is plugged into a Servo motor on the front of the car casing giving the mobile vacuum cleaner the ability to avoid obstacles in a range of 12cm and a degree view of 180 Degrees. This allows the vacuum cleaner to avoid sizable obstacles.

### Bluetooth Control:
The vacuum cleaner should be paired to the device which contains the app. The HC-05 Bluetooth module will allow the vacuum cleaner to connect with the device. This mode allows the user to control the vacuum cleaner using the user's own measures.

### Voice Recognition:
The HC-05 module will also help with the Voice Recognition Process. User instructions should be given to the Application which is used to control the voice recognition mode. These instruction signals will be emitted to the Arduino board when the particular word is spoken.

### Face Recognition:
Instructions required for this face recognition process are also provided to the face recognition Application. HC-05 module will also connect the Application with the vacuum cleaner‚Äôs Arduino board, which will trigger the necessary instructions by recognizing the face.

### Interactive Gate Mechanism:
Circuit components related to the gate are placed inside of an obstacle which is powered using another Arduino board. This showcases that the vacuum cleaner can operate in secured environments too.
